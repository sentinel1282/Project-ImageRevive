# Project-ImageRevive
ImageRevive is an agentic generative AI framework that intelligently orchestrates specialized models to restore degraded images. Leveraging pretrained Hugging Face architectures—including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), VQ-VAE-2, and transformer-based networks—the system performs four core restoration tasks: denoising, 2x-4x super-resolution, intelligent colorization, and context-aware inpainting. Through transfer learning and fine-tuning on paired datasets, ImageRevive achieves professional-grade results across diverse applications: historical photograph preservation for cultural heritage digitization, medical imaging enhancement for diagnostic accuracy, and forensic image analysis. By unifying these complementary restoration capabilities into an accessible platform, ImageRevive democratizes advanced image restoration technology previously limited to technical specialists.

Core Objectives:
•	Denoising: Remove noise while preserving structural details
•	Super-Resolution: Enhance low-resolution images to high-quality outputs
•	Colorization: Intelligently colorize grayscale images with realistic palettes
•	Inpainting: Seamlessly fill missing/damaged regions with contextual content
